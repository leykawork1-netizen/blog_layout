Jekyll themes make it easy to get started, but customizing them lets your site stand out.

## Step 1: Copy the Theme Files
Run:
Copy the theme’s assets into your project so you can modify them.

## Step 2: Adjust the Layouts
Layouts live in the `_layouts` folder. Update the HTML structure to fit your brand.

## Step 3: Edit CSS or Add Your Own
Modify `assets/css` or create a custom stylesheet to override default styles.

## Step 4: Add Custom Includes
Use `_includes` to create reusable components like headers or banners.

## Conclusion
With a few tweaks, you can transform a stock Jekyll theme into something uniquely yours.
