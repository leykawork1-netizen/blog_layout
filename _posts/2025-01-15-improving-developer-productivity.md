Developer productivity continues to evolve quickly as new tools and workflows emerge. Here are a few ways to stay ahead:

## 1. Automate the Boring Stuff
Automation is no longer optional. Scripts, CI pipelines, and editor macros save hours each week.

## 2. Use AI-Powered Assistants Wisely
Tools like code assistants and documentation generators reduce cognitive load and help you stay focused.

## 3. Reduce Context Switching
Batch similar tasks together and silence notifications while coding.

## Conclusion
Productivity in 2025 is about optimizing the *environment* you code in. Small gains compound over time.
