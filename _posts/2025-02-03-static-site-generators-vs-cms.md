Choosing between a static site generator (SSG) and a traditional CMS can shape the future of your project. Here’s how they differ:

## Performance
SSGs like Jekyll create blazing-fast websites because pages are pre-built.

## Security
Traditional CMS platforms can be vulnerable due to databases and admin panels. Static sites eliminate most of these risks.

## Flexibility
CMS platforms offer more built-in features, while SSGs excel in developer control and customization.

## Final Thoughts
If you value speed, security, and version control, an SSG is a strong choice. If you prefer non-technical editing, a CMS may be better.
