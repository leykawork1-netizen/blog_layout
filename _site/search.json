    "content": "You’ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.\n\nJekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:\n\nYEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP\n\nWhere YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.\n\nJekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:\n\ndef print_hi(name)\n  puts \"Hi, #{name}\"\nend\nprint_hi('Tom')\n#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.\n\nCheck out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk.\n\n"

    "content": "The Dalai Lama and the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize In 1989, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his lifelong commitment to nonviolence, compassion, and the peaceful resolution of conflict. This historic moment not only honored his efforts for the Tibetan people but also cemented his place as one of the world’s most influential moral leaders. A Life Dedicated to Peace The Dalai Lama has long advocated for compassion, mindfulness, and coexistence. Even after the political upheaval in Tibet and his exile in 1959, he consistently promoted dialogue instead of confrontation. His approach, often described as a Middle Way, emphasized: Respect for all cultures and religions Nonviolent solutions to political conflict Human rights and freedom The idea that peace begins with inner transformation These values aligned deeply with the goals of the Nobel Peace Prize. Why He Was Awarded the Prize The Nobel Committee recognized him for: His unwavering commitment to nonviolence, even in the face of oppression. His efforts to preserve Tibetan culture and identity through peaceful means. His global influence as a teacher of compassion and ethics, far beyond political boundaries. His promotion of peace between nations, especially through spiritual..."

    "content": "Choosing between a static site generator (SSG) and a traditional CMS can shape the future of your project. Here’s how they differ:\n\nPerformance\nSSGs like Jekyll create blazing-fast websites because pages are pre-built.\n\nSecurity\nTraditional CMS platforms can be vulnerable due to databases and admin panels. Static sites eliminate most of these risks.\n\nFlexibility\nCMS platforms offer more built-in features, while SSGs excel in developer control and customization.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you value speed, security, and version control, an SSG is a strong choice. If you prefer non-technical editing, a CMS may be better.\n"
